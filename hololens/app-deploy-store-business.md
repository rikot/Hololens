# Microsoft Store for Business & Intune

With the [retirement](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/adding-your-microsoft-store-for-business-and-education-apps-to/ba-p/3788506) of the [Microsoft Store for Business](/microsoft-store/microsoft-store-for-business-overview), a new and improved Microsoft Store app management experience is available in Intune, leveraging Windows Package Manager and other improvements.  For more details, read [Update to Intune integration with the Microsoft Store on Windows](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/update-to-intune-integration-with-the-microsoft-store-on-windows/ba-p/3585077)

A Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution enables IT administrators to distribute and auto-install apps to the managed HoloLens 2 devices in their organization. HoloLens 2 devices work best with Microsoft __Intune__ as the MDM solution.

The following instructions describe how to download HoloLens 2 apps from the __Microsoft Store for Business__, and then to distribute those apps to your managed HoloLens 2 devices using Intune.

> [!Note]
> Microsoft has [announced plans to retire](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/support-tip-microsoft-store-for-business-retirement-and-windows/ba-p/3662691) the Microsoft Store for Business.   However, the original retirement date, March 31<sup>st</sup> 2023, has been postponed, with a new retirement date yet to be announced. The instructions below can be used until the Microsoft Store for Business is retired.
>
> When the Microsoft Store for Business is retired, Microsoft plans to enable an alternative process for downloading an app package.  The step to distribute an app package to HoloLens 2 devices will not change.


__Step 1: Download an app package__

To prepare for distributing an app to HoloLens 2 devices using Intune, you first need to download the app package file from the Microsoft Store for Business (or obtain the app package file directly from the app vendor).

1. __Configure the Microsoft Store for Business website to display offline apps__:   
    1. Using a web browser on a PC, sign in to the [Microsoft Store for Business](https://businessstore.microsoft.com/).
    1. Click __Manage__ (on the top navigation).
    1. Click __Settings__ (on the left navigation).
    1. Click __Shop.__
   1. Under __Shopping experience__, ensure that __Show offline apps__ is enabled.

1. __Shop for the app and add it into your group inventory__:   
    1. Using a web browser on a PC, sign in to the [Microsoft Store for Business](https://businessstore.microsoft.com/).
    1. In the top navigation bar, click __Shop for my group__.
    1. Using the search box on the top navigation bar, __search__ for the name of the app that you're looking for. When you find the app, click on it.
    1. On the app page, for __License type__ select __Offline.__
    1. Click __Get the app__. This will add the app to your group inventory in the Microsoft Store for Business website.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you do not see the **Get the app** button next to the app, the app may already be in your group inventory.
    >
    > To be able to add apps into the group inventory, you must have one of the following [security roles in the Microsoft Store for Business](/microsoft-store/roles-and-permissions-microsoft-store-for-business): **Admin**, and/or **Purchaser**. If you do not have one of these roles, then when you shop for apps, you may see the option to [request apps](/microsoft-store/acquire-apps-microsoft-store-for-business). Submitting a request for an app will send an automated email with the request to the relevant administrator(s) in your organization, who will then need to decide whether to add the app.
    >
    > If the app you are looking for is not available for offline download from the Microsoft Store for Business, you will need to contact the app vendor to request the offline app package (appx file).

1. __Download the offline app package and required frameworks (if any)__:   
    1. Using a web browser on a PC, sign in to the [Microsoft Store for Business](https://businessstore.microsoft.com/).
    1. On the top navigation bar, click __Manage__.
    1. Under __Products & services__, select __Manage apps__.
    1. Find the app that you are looking for in the list. Click the app name.
    1. Under __Download package for offline use__, set __Platform__ to __Windows 10 HoloLens__.
    1. Click __Download__ to download the app package (appx file).
    1. Scroll down to the __Required frameworks.__ If any required frameworks are listed, click the __Download__ button next to each to download them all. (Some apps may not have any required frameworks)

> [!NOTE]
> Dynamics 365 Guides and Dynamics 365 Remote Assist are pre-installed on HoloLens 2 devices. If you use Windows Autopilot for managed device setup, these apps will automatically be updated to the latest versions during device setup.

__Step 2: Distribute an app package to HoloLens 2 devices__

Once you have downloaded an app package file (see above), you can use Intune to [distribute it as a line-of-business app](/mem/intune/apps/lob-apps-windows) to auto-install on HoloLens 2 devices.

## Smart Retry for app updates

- Introduced in [Windows Holographic, version 21H2](hololens-release-notes.md#windows-holographic-version-21h2).

Now enabled for HoloLens is a new policy that allows IT Admins to set a recurring or one time date to restart apps whose update failed due to the app being in use allowing the update to be applied. These can be set based on a few different triggers such as a scheduled time or sign-in. To learn more about how to use this policy please view [ApplicationManagement/ScheduleForceRestartForUpdateFailures](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-applicationmanagement#applicationmanagement-scheduleforcerestartforupdatefailures).
