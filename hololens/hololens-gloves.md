# Using HoloLens 2 With Gloves

If your need to wear gloves for your work, you may have found that some types of gloves don't work with hand tracking. This article outlines the best practices for finding gloves that work with hand tracking, and offers a few examples of common types of gloves.

## Challenges with Gloves
A common example is black rubber gloves, which tend to absorb infrared light and the depth camera doesn't pick them up. If your work involves rubber gloves, we recommend trying a lighter color such as blue or gray. Another example is large baggy gloves, which tend to obscure the shape of your hand. We recommend using gloves that are as form-fitting as possible for best results.
