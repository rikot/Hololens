# HoloLens 2 capabilities and solutions

## Why HoloLens?

Thanks to HoloLens 2 and Mixed Reality applications, now workers can collaborate without boundaries, act with precision, and increase productivity.

Collaborate without boundaries and act with precision to increase employee productivity with mixed reality applications on HoloLens 2. Stay engaged heads-up, hands free longer and more comfortably with built-in voice commands, eye tracking, and world-anchoring for continuous focus on safely completing tasks without errors. Connect with remote colleagues in real-time and work together across an extensive holographic canvas overlayed in your physical environment to quickly resolve issues at the point of work. Realize return on investment (ROI) right out of the box with a robust ecosystem of applications that are supported with the security, reliability, and scalability of Microsoft.  

We hope this article inspires you to think of all the ways in which mixed reality (MR) will benefit your business.
