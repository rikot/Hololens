# HoloLens 2 security baselines

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some of the policies used in this security baseline are introduced in our latest [Insider build](hololens-insider.md). These policies will only function on devices updated to the latest Insider build.

This article lists and describes the various security baseline settings you can configure on HoloLens 2 using Configuration Service Providers (CSP). As part of your mobile device management using Microsoft Endpoint Manager (formally known as Microsoft Intune), use the following standard or advanced security baseline settings depending on your organizational policies and needs. Use these security baseline settings to help protect your organizational resources.

- Standard security baseline settings are applicable to all types of users irrespective of the use case scenario and industry vertical.
- Advanced security baseline settings are recommended settings for users who have strict security controls of their environment, and require stringent security policies for devices used in their environment.

These security baseline settings are based on Microsoft’s best practice guidelines and experience gained in deploying and supporting HoloLens 2 devices to customers in various industries.

Once you've reviewed the security baseline and decided to use the one, both, or parts, then check out [how to enable these security base lines](#how-to-enable-these-security-base-lines)

## 1. Standard security baseline settings

## How to enable these security base lines

1. Review the security baseline, and decide what to apply.
1. Determine the Azure Groups that you'll assign the baseline to. ([More on users and groups](hololens2-cloud-connected-configure.md#azure-users-and-groups))
1. Create the baseline.

Here's how to create the baseline.

Many of the settings can be added by using the Settings catalog, however there may sometimes be a setting that hasn't yet been populated to the Settings catalog. In those cases, you'll use a Custom policy, or OMA-URI (Open Mobile Alliance - Uniform Resource Identifier). Start by looking in the Settings catalog, and if it's not found this follow the instructions below for creating a custom policy via OMA-URI.

### Settings catalog

Log into your account on the [MEM admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/#home).

1. Navigate to **Devices** -> **Configuration profiles** -> **+Create profile**. For Platform, select **Windows 10 and later**, and for profile type select **Settings catalog (preview)**.
1. Create a name for the profile, and select the **Next** button.
1. On the Configuration settings screen, select **+ Add settings**.

Using the name of the policy from the baseline above, you can search for the policy. The settings catalog will space out the name, so to find "Accounts/AllowMicrosoftAccountConnection" you'll need to search "Allow Microsoft Account Connection". After you search, you'll see the list of policies reduced to just the CSP which has this policy. Select **Accounts** (or the relevant CSP to what you are current searching), once you do you'll see the policy result below. Check the box for the policy.

Once done, the panel on the left will add the CSP category, and the setting that you added. From here you can configure it from the default setting, to one more secure.

You can continue to keep adding multiple configurations to the same profile, which will make it easier to assign at once.

### Adding custom OMA-URI policies

Some policies may not be available in the Settings catalog yet. For these policies, you'll need to [create a custom OMA-URI profile](/troubleshoot/mem/intune/deploy-oma-uris-to-target-csp-via-intune).Log into your account on the [MEM admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/#home).

1. Navigate to **Devices** -> **Configuration profiles** -> **+Create profile**. For Platform, select **Windows 10 and later**, and for profile type select **Templates** and select **Custom**.
1. Create a name for the profile, and select the **Next** button.
1. Select the **Add** button.

You'll need to fill out a few fields.

- Name, you may name it anything you need related to the policy. This can be a shorthand name you use to recognize it.
- Description will be more details you might need.
- The OMA-URI will be the full OMA-URI string where the policy is. Example: `./Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/MixedReality/AADGroupMembershipCacheValidityInDays`
- Data type is the type of value this policy accepts. For this example it's a number between 0 and 60, so Integer was selected.
- Once you select the data type, you'll be able to write out, or upload, the value needed into the field.

Once done, your policy is added to the main window. You can continue adding all your custom policies to the same custom configuration. This helps reduce managing multiple device configurations and makes assignment easier.
